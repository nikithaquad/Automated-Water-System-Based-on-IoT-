# Automated-Water-System-Based-on-IoT
The Automated Water System has been developed to monitor water consumption and reduce the water wastage. The Automated Water System is potentially designed for live monitoring of the water consumption and limiting the water wastage when water consumption crosses the designed threshold level. Specifically, the water system designed is smart enough to continuously monitor the water level in the overhead tank; also, the automated water system monitors the amount of water used and restricts further water usage once the consumption reaches the pre-designed water level. The water level is continuously updated to the cloud and can be regularly monitored by the user. The Automated Water System is implemented using Arduino UNO, a low-cost controller. The system is pre-designed with specific threshold values; based on these values, the water system monitors and controls the water level and water usage simultaneously. Features like low-cost and automated water monitoring make it advantageous to commercial applications.
